# Bloccit: a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

See a live demo of this project at [http://jose-bloccit.herokuapp.com/](http://jose-bloccit.herokuapp.com/)

## Environment Variables
There are a couple of environment variables you will need to set. Create the file __config/application.yml__ and set variables referensed in __config/application.example.yml__. Currently these variables are for Sendgrid and Devise.
